# Xtract
A web application to make open-source intelligence an easier and more accessible process, it focuses on social media public data collection. Users can search using a personâ€™s name to find all possible results of accounts holding the same name on three platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook). Then they can utilize this information to collect data from respective user accounts across these platforms.
The Project's UI is developed using VUE.js and the backend logic uses both Node.js and Python.
